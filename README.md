This is the readme for my project!

WHAT IS FIO?
FIO is a small webApp that I developed using HTML, Python, and CSS.
It takes input from the user and shows the 5 day forecast for 
the city and state they entered.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The python code makes use of Flask to help build the pages of the 
website when it retireves the data requested from an api.

THE PROJECT OVER THE WEEK
This webApp was in development from 8/25/2021-9/1/2021 

Over this week the project took a couple forms. It was originally going to 
be done in HTML, CSS, and CGI(ruby). But, I was having difficulties with getting
apache to find the cgi files needed to execute the code. I was going to find 
somewhere that would serve the file and execute the code, but in the end decided
to commit to a new solution. 
I ended up with flask becasuse I was able to have apache find and use the files
needed to execute the python code. The app is currently being hosted on Linode
via apache.
